### Heroes of Pymoli - Pandas-Challenge

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data wrangling mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report includes the following:


<B>Three observable trends based on the data:</B>
# Observable Trends
 - The most popular, reported gender demographic for video game players is far and away the Male demographic, at 84.03%. (Which, based on experience - is fitting,    but we definitely need more female gamers!)
 - The vast majority, at 44.79% of video game players - are in the age bracket of 20-24. The second most popular age group demographic is 15-19.
